# Rate Plots

The rate plots show the rate contribution of the objects as a function of pT
threshold.

There are two configurations for the rate plots.

  1. Evaluation of the rates of different objects from the same version (e.g. V30).
  2. Comparison of the same objects of two different versions (e.g. V29 vs. V30).

*NOTE*: In the latter case, object names must match between the two specified
versions to form a vaild comparsion config.
