# Rate Plots

There are two configurations for the rate plots.
One is the evaluation of the rates of different objects
from the same version (e.g. V30). The other is the comparison
of the same objects of two different versions (e.g. V29 vs. V30).
In the latter case, object names must match between the two specified
versions to form a vaild comparsion config.
